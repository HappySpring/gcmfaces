| | Four approaches to gridding the Earth which are all commonly used in
  numerical models. Top left: lat-lon grid; mapping the Earth to a
  single rectangular array (‘face’). Top right: cube-sphere grid;
  mapping the earth to the six faces of a cube. Bottom right:
  lat-lon-cap, ‘LLC’, grid (five faces). Bottom left: quadripolar grid
  (four faces). In this depiction, faces are color-coded, only grid line
  subsets are shown, and gaps are introduced between faces to highlight
  the defining characteristics of each grid. |
