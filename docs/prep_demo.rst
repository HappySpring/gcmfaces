The gcmfaces_demo.m Tutorial
============================

To proceed further, user should have completed the installation
procedure in section \ `[getting started] <#getting started>`__
including for nctiles_climatology/ and m_map/. To illustrate gcmfaces
capabilities, gcmfaces_demo.m can then be executed by opening Matlab and
typing

::

    p = genpath('gcmfaces/'); addpath(p);
    p = genpath('m_map/'); addpath(p);
    gcmfaces_demo;

As prompted by , users specify the desired amount of explanatory text
output. then proceeds various the examples while displaying comments in
the Matlab command window. The Matlab GUI and debugger can also be used
to run the examples line by line to learn more about the inner workings
of functions.

The first section in gcmfaces_demo.m illustrates I/O and plotting
capabilities (grid_load.m and example_display.m). relies on
`m_map <https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~rich/map.html>`__) for map projections
via the m_map_gcmfaces front-end that typically produces
Fig. \ `[plot_one_field_M_MAP] <#plot_one_field_M_MAP>`__. The second
section in gcmfaces_demo.m focuses on data processing capabilities such
as interpolation (example_interp.m) and smoothing (example_smooth.m).
example_interp.m interpolates fields to a lat-lon grid and vice versa.
example_smooth.m integrates a diffusion equation which involves tracer
gradient and flux convergence computations. The final section in
gcmfaces_demo.m computes oceanic transports (example_transports.m).

   generated by calling example_display(4).
