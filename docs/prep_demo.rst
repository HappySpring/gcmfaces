The `gcmfaces_demo.m` Tutorial
==============================

To proceed further, user should have completed the installation
procedure in :numref:`getting_started`
including for nctiles_climatology/ and m_map/. To illustrate gcmfaces
capabilities, ``gcmfaces_demo.m`` can then be executed by opening Matlab and
typing

::

    p = genpath('gcmfaces/'); addpath(p);
    p = genpath('m_map/'); addpath(p);
    gcmfaces_demo;

As prompted by , users specify the desired amount of explanatory text
output. then proceeds various the examples while displaying comments in
the Matlab command window. The Matlab GUI and debugger can also be used
to run the examples line by line to learn more about the inner workings
of functions.

The first section in ``gcmfaces_demo.m`` illustrates I/O and plotting
capabilities (``grid_load.m`` and ``example_display.m``). relies on
`m_map <https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~rich/map.html>`__) for map projections
via the m_map_gcmfaces front-end that typically produces
:numref:`plot_one_field_M_MAP`. The second
section in ``gcmfaces_demo.m`` focuses on data processing capabilities such
as interpolation (``example_interp.m``) and smoothing (``example_smooth.m``).
``example_interp.m`` interpolates fields to a lat-lon grid and vice versa.
``example_smooth.m`` integrates a diffusion equation which involves tracer
gradient and flux convergence computations. The final section in
``gcmfaces_demo.m`` computes oceanic transports (``example_transports.m``).

   :name: plot_one_field_M_MAP

   Same as :numref:`plot_one_field_FACES` but
   plotted in geographical coordinates using ``m_map_gcmfaces.m``. This plot
   is generated by calling example_display(4).
