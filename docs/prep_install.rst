Install Software
----------------

Download the latest software version from `github <https://github.com/gaelforget/>`__ by typing 

::

    git clone https://github.com/gaelforget/gcmfaces
    git clone https://github.com/gaelforget/MITprof

at the command line or using the github web browser interface. This method allows users to update the software later on and to manage their own, if any, code modifications. Archived frozen versions of the software, which can be cited in publications using permanent digital object identifiers, are also available via `zenodo <https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/62541910>`__. Additionally, `gcmfaces` relies on the `m_map` toolbox for geographic projections (:numref:`plot_one_field_M_MAP`). To download `m_map`, follow directions provided by `this webpage <https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~rich/map.html>`__.

Obtain Input Data
-----------------

To get started in :numref:`getting_started` and :numref:`features`,
downloading ``nctiles_grid/`` (145M) either from `this ftp
server <ftp://mit.ecco-group.org/ecco_for_las/version_4/release2/nctiles_grid/>`__
or from `this permanent archive <http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/H8W5VW>`__ is sufficient. 
:numref:`demo` andÂ :numref:`standard` use ``nctiles_climatology/`` (10G)
to illustrate higher-level functionalities. One method to download these data sets at the command line 
is shown in :ref:`downloads`. Commands reported hereafter assume that downloaded contents 
have been organized as shown in :ref:`gcmfaces_demo_dirtree`.

The other input data sets shown in :ref:`gcmfaces_demo_dirtree` (inside of ``release2/``)
are not be needed unless user wants to reproduce the full set of plots in :cite:`dspace-eccov4r2`. 
The contents of ``profiles/`` (7G) and ``nctiles_remotesensing/`` (27G) allow for model-data 
comparisons, while ``nctiles_monthly/`` (170G) contains monthly 
time series of ocean variables over 1992-2011. These can be used 
to reproduce the plots in :cite:`dspace-eccov4r2` via a few 
function calls as explained at the end of :numref:`standard`.

Activate gcmfaces
-----------------

Once ``gcmfaces/`` and ``nctiles_grid/`` have been placed in a
common directory as shown in :ref:`gcmfaces_demo_dirtree`,
open Matlab or Octave from within that directory and type:

::

    %add gcmfaces and MITprof directories to Matlab path:
    p = genpath('gcmfaces/'); addpath(p);
    %p = genpath('MITprof/'); addpath(p);

    %load all grid variables from nctiles_grid/ into mygrid:
    grid_load; 

    %make mygrid accessible in current workspace:
    gcmfaces_global;

    %display list of grid variables:
    disp(mygrid);

    %display one gcmfaces variable:
    disp(mygrid.XC);
